This is an Angular2 app that is transpiled to run on only client-side js.
It's an app that uses the Twitch API to produce a Twitch Live Stream Search.

(By default Angular2/TypeScript apps can only be run via Node until they are modified to run client-side only. My orginal code base for this app that runs on top of node is at: https://github.com/jclas/twitch)
